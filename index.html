 <h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page!</h2>
 <p>My name is Christiana Ondrak, aka Wild Raccoon and I really enjoy creating all kinds of stuff. <br>
I started with traditional painting first but quickly I got interested in digital art and began working with Photoshop, Illustrator and Procreate.<br>
Surrealism, space and animals are the main topics I am using in my pictures. Looking at my artworks you will notice that I also have a little obsession with raccoons, that's also the reason for my artist name. </br>
I was thinking about selling my art so I opened my own online shop at <a href="https://redbubble.com/people/Chriiistl/shop?asc=u" target="_blank">Redbubble</a> and <a href="https://displate.com/wildracoon?art=5d45d87b1d7e7" target="_blank">Displate</a>. </br>
Recently I began to create paintings with Midjourney AI which is a funny tool to experiment with. <br>
As I always enjoy learning new skills I am currently into programming with HTML and CSS. This is how I got the idea of creating my own website. <br>
So yeah, basically this is the whole story so have fun exploring it and I really hope my art will bring you joy!
